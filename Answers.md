1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

From the given diagram, it can be observed that there is a one-to-many relationship between the "Product Category" and "Product" entities. 
Each record in the "Product Category" table can be associated with multiple records in the "Product" table.
This relationship is established through the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, which is a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "Product Category" table.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce a NOT NULL constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. 
This constraint will ensure that every new product record inserted into the table must have a valid category ID associated with it.
